# antispam
If someone tries to have you say "yes" over the phone in order to record your voice, fire up this little Python script in your UNIX/Linux shell and tell them where they can go. 
Let's fight robocalls with their same weapons. I'm sick and tired of these scammers calling every day.
The script contains the path to Python in the shebang already, so you can simply run it with ./antispam.py, no need to prepend "python" to your command.
